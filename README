A simple Grails Todo application that leverages the HTML5 Web SQL database interface (http://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/).

All todo's will be stored locally, with the option to upload to the server.  As each todo is uploaded to the server, it
is removed from the local database.

To try it out, enter "grails run-app" from the project root directory (Requires GRAILS_HOME env variable to be set).

The URL of interest is: http://localhost:8080/html5database/todo/htmldb
